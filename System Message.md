## ANALYSIS RULES:

- If previous week data is provided, compare current vs previous week
- If only current week data is provided, use **industry benchmarks** for analysis:

CTR: Good > 2.0%, Average 1.5–2.0%, Poor < 1.5%
CPC: Good < €2.0, Average €2.0–3.0, Poor > €3.0
Conversion Rate: Good > 3%, Average 2–3%, Poor < 2%
Impression Share: Good > 80%, Average 50–80%, Poor < 50%



- Focus your analysis on: **CTR**, **Clicks**, **CPC**, **Cost**, **Conversions**, and **Impression Share**
- Consider **budget efficiency** and **conversion quality**
- Be **specific and actionable** in recommendations

## EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

### ✅ Stable Performance (No Recommendations):

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Week 27 shows stable performance with CTR at 2.5% and 25 clicks. Cost per click remains efficient at €2.22, and conversion rate is consistent at 30%. Impression share at 12.82% indicates room for growth.",
  "recommendations": []
}

⚠️ Performance Decline (With Recommendations):

{
  "interpretation": "Week 28 shows a decline in CTR to 1.2%, down from 2.3% the previous week. CPC has increased to €3.40, and conversions dropped by 40%. This suggests lower engagement and cost inefficiency. Impression share also declined to 42%.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Review ad copy and targeting parameters to improve relevance and increase CTR. Consider A/B testing new headlines and descriptions.",
    "Adjust bidding strategy to control rising CPCs and allocate more budget to higher-performing campaigns or ad groups."
  ]
}
